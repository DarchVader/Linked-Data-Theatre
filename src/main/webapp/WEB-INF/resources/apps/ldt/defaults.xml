    DESCRIPTION
    Default submission, will be overriden by specific setvalue parameters in page-flow.xml
 
    You should configure defaults.xml to your local settings:
	- env: the environment (prod, test, dev). Only in dev will runtime errors be visible. Default = prod
    - configuration-endpoint: the SPARQL endpoint which contains the configurations of the Linked Data Theatre
    - local-endpoint: the SPARQL endpoint that is used as the default endpoint to fetch data
    - the tempdir, if any: the absolute path to the directory to be used by the linked data theatre for temporary files (default is the tomcat temp dir)
    - the representation-graph sets the graph that contains the configuration. Should be set for every domainname that is servered by the LDT
      - site: the domainname for this configuration
	  - uri: the uri of the named graph that contains the configuration
  	  - icon: (optional) the favicon.ico that is visible for this domain
	  - docroot: (optional) use the docroot if the LDT is serving only a subdirectory (for example: http://mydomain.org/linkeddatatheatre/...)
